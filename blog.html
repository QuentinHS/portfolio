              <h2>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h2>
              <p><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Posted by <strong>Quentin Haly-Summerfield</strong> | 23 November 2021</p>
            </div>
            <p>Jiu Jitsu is sometimes referred to as the gentle art, but people who have tried it might disagree with this description. It's closer to an ego-destroying version of high intensity interval training, except your goal is to stop your opponent actively trying to choke you or dislocate your limbs. If the appeal seems hard to grasp based on this description, that's understandable. I'd estimate about 90% of people who try a class won't come back. Jiu jitsu unveils its magic gradually though, creeping into your life and changing the way you view your body and the world around you. There's a meme going around lately along the lines of  “Random person: What’s BJJ like? Me: It’s like Fight Club but you talk about it all the time.”
            </p>
            <p>As a sport, bbj can also seem indicipherable to outsiders. If you've watched MMA, some of the positions might make sense. If you haven't, all you might see is a random tangle of limbs. But there's an elegance behind the vaneer of anarchy, moves executed with precious, strategy and purpose. People sometimes compare bjj to chess; while this has an element of truth, bjj is more fluid, and has even more possibilities and combinations. There's a surprising intellectualism to it, as you analyse your own game and those of others, seeking weak points, trying to counter your opponents strengths. And yes, strength does matter; but it's not the only thing. If your opponent is stronger, your technique has to be better. I see petite women choke out large, complacent men all the time. It's also an intensely personal sport, that embraces comradery, support and consent. There's masculity and bravado too, sometimes even toxicity. But it requires you to learn to trust your opponents, and understand that even when they're trying their hardest to beat you, they're not trying hurt you. Well, at least not too much.</p>

            <p>If Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is my exercise, riding my motorbike is my meditation. It's only been a little more than a year since I decided to actually use my restricted license and ignore the warnings my father always gave me about accidents, and own personal experience coming off scooters multiple times in South-East Asia. Of course, being me, I didn't exactly decide spontaenously, and certainly didn't choose a bike without research. I needed transport, didn't want the hassle of a car, and thought learning to rike a motorbike properly in Australia would be good and relatively gentle practice for the across continent journeys I'd always envisioned in my future. Of course, I didn't take into account how many Australian car drivers actively see themselves as competing against motorcycles for lane space. 
            </p>
            <p> I ended up choosing a Kawasaki Z400 for my first bike, and it's been one of the best decisions I've ever made. It helps that the bike itself is as closer to the perfect beginner bike as you can imagine. It's light, nimble and accelerates like lighting, but is also incredibly forgiving, and won't do anything you're not expecting. I may be eyeing up bigger bikes at the moment, but it would be a wrench giving up my Z400, and I'd much rather pass it on to a friend or family member who wants to learn to ride. Having spent so many years travelling overseas though, my motorbike has given me the chance to explore Australia in a way that I haven't since I took road trips with my family when I was young. I always found it hard to justify a car trip to go somewhere for the sake of it, because I never really enjoyed actually driving cars. But on a motorbike, the ride itself is the reward, and the destination is just a bonus.</p>
